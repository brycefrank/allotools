`allotools` is an R package that aggregates allometric models from the package [allometric](https://github.com/brycefrank/allometric)
into larger biomass and volume estimation systems. These larger aggregations are referred to as `tools`, and facilitate rapid use of 
these complex systems. A canonical example of a `tool` is the "component ratio method" (`crm`) used by the FIA to predict tree-level biomasses.
Other systems, such as the national Canadian and Spanish biomass modeling frameworks will also be made available.

Users interested in finding and using individual allometric models will be better served by [allometric](https://github.com/brycefrank/allometric).
